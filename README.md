# INST326 Final Project - Small Business Loans

For our final project, we decided to analyze data found within a CSV file to allow us to find trends within small business loans.  Some of the trends that we are looking for include average bank loan, which banks are more likely to provide a loan and if certain states and business types recieve loans more frequently.  In the scope of this project, we applied a number of different skills learned in our class.  We used dictionaries to help us keep count, as the key and value component made it easy to keep count of business loans.  In addition to this, we use our knowledge of CSV files to help open the file, however due to the characters in the CSV file we had to include an encoding method that would allow for us to open it.  

Based on our functions, we were able to determine the average bank loan in the data set is $194,518.57.  Additionally, we were able to find out that U.S. Bank National Association gave out loans most frequently with 10 of the loans given, Ohio was the state were loans were given out the most, and finally we determined that of the various business types, corporations were the business most likely to recieve a loan.
