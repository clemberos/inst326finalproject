# INST326 Final Project - Small Business Loans

For our final project, we decided to analyze data found within a CSV file to allow us to find trends within small business loans.  Some of the trends that we are looking for include average bank loan, which banks are more likely/less likely to provide a loan and if certain states recieve loans more frequently.  The most common data analysis tool we are using in the scope of this project is pandas within Python, as this will allow for us to find trends within the data.
